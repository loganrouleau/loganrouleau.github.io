I built this site to introduce myself to web frameworks. I would eventually like it to become my landing page, but for now it is a simple blog for me to discuss hobbies and interests like running. The next big enhancement will be comment integration.

At first I tried out a few built-in Jekyll themes, but the current rendition is not strongly based on anything. I prefer a simple minimalist style. You can find out more about creating a static website with Jekyll at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/).
